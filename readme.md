## Readme

This document describes three simple Dart programs:

## Task 1:
This program greets a user by their name and faculty, and introduces them as a doctor.

## Task 2: 
This program greets a user by their name and surname, and calculates their age based on their year of birth.

## Task 3: 
This program reads a number from the user and prints whether it is positive, negative, or neither.

To run any of these programs, save the Dart code as a `.dart` file and run it in a terminal using the following command:

```
dart <file_name.dart>
```

For example, to run the program in Task 1, you would run the following command:

```
dart task1.dart
```

This will prompt you to enter your name, surname, and faculty. Once you have entered this information, the program will print a greeting like the following:

```
Nice to meet you at the Faculty of Engineering, Dr. Bard.
```

To run the program in Task 2, you would run the following command:

```
dart task2.dart
```

This will prompt you to enter your name, surname, and year of birth. Once you have entered this information, the program will print your age like the following:

```
Dear Bard, you are 25 years old.
```

To run the program in Task 3, you would run the following command:

```
dart task3.dart
```

This will prompt you to enter a number. Once you have entered a number, the program will print whether it is positive, negative, or neither. For example, if you enter the number 5, the program will print the following:

```
Number is positive.
```

If you enter the number -5, the program will print the following:

```
Number is negative.
```

And if you enter the number 0, the program will print the following:

```
Number is neither positive nor negative.
```
